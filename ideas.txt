to get unseen fen:
    get all pgns from all games
    convert each move set into fen (depending on wanted depth)
    compare all of these fen against the current position
        not 'all', every fen for the current move (eg if its move 1, look at fen from this. if its 10,from this)

effeciently converting all pgn
    bottleneck of the program


keeping the chosen move with the fen    
    maybe use a dict? 
        move : fen
